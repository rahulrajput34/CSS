<!-- Media Queries -->
<!-- we are going to use JavaScript for the mobile responsive in big projects -->
<!-- By using media queries, we can create designs that adapt and look good on different devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. For instance, we might use a media query to set different font sizes, change the layout, or hide/show certain elements depending on the screen width. -->
